this repository contains some of my personal scripts and modules that integrate
with my other projects, or facilitate copying and pasting a bunch of otherwise
tedious chores.

these are mostly here for reference only; you are welcome to look at them or use
them if you wish, but please do not provide unsolicited contributions here.
