you can run `pydoc {module}` on anything in here for more detailed information,
but here's a summary:

**ircformatter.py**
    formats incoming irc message to a couple of more easily-handled objects

**vtils.py**
    some commonly-used text and terminal handling functions and shortcuts. yes,
    i know things like this already exist, but i'm a control freak and need
    these specific things.
