i have no idea why anyone else would touch this bs, but in case you do, you have
the following unrestricted permissions: use, copy, modify, merge, publish,
distribute

if you do any of those things in a way that people who aren't you might see
it, i would appreciate my bs facerolling credited to "vincent zeng
(hvincent@modgethanc.com)". i probably won't do anything about it if you
don't, but do so knowing it's against my preferences.

i do not guarantee the safety of anything in your life, should you choose to
use my lazy keysmashing. please be careful out there.
